# Milestone 2 - Initialization of Environment Variables

This milestone sets up environment variables to securely manage API keys for IBM Watsonx, Pinecone, and Google Classroom.

## âœ… Completed:
- Created a .env file locally (not uploaded) for storing API keys.
- Used python-dotenv in Python to load them securely.
- Added .env to .gitignore so it's never pushed to GitHub
